#+author: Skshm

Includes relatively simple projects

* [[file:/FlipkartPriceChkr/][Flipkart Price Check]]
+ Emails a user when price fals below a specific range
+ Looks for change in the price class of the provided flipkart Link
  - If its lower than the input it activates the url shortner API and email client
    * Then emails with the heading of the Product and set price. And body contains the link and price.
+ Refer to [[file:/FlipkartPriceChkr/Flipkart_Price_Chk.ipynb][Flipkart Jupyter File]] for more explaination

* [[file:/CLI/Doomsday_Cal/][Doomsday Clock]]
This is a simple doomsday calculation algorithm that will tell you the day it will be for the given date

*Not to be confused with the [[img:https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Doomsday_Clock_100_seconds_mark.png][Doomsday Clock]]*

+ The program is not tested for all years and dates so problems may occur I'm not sure
+ The [[file:/CLI/Doomsday_Cal/Alternates.ipynb][jupyter Notebook]] includes the following:
  - An anchor year checker
  - Doomsday Calculation using modules

** '[[file:/CLI/Doomsday_Cal/TestThings.ipynb][Test Things]]' includes
  - Files used to make the python file itself.
  - Division of parts based on use for easy modification.

* [[file:/PyGam/SudokuMakerSolver/][Sudoku Maker and Solver]]
Creates new soduku puzzles and has the ability to solves them. I no longer remember doing it but it works.

* [[file:/Imaging/][Image Processing]]
** [[file:/Imaging/Image_Based-Recog/][Image Recognition]]
Is able to recognize images based on the training data provided. 
Uses the =MNIST dataset= for training and testing. And is a simple neural network that uses the backpropagation algorithm to train itself. 
It is not very accurate but it works!
** [[file:/Imaging/Colour_Analysis/][Color Pallete Extracter]]
Uses ~sklearn~ and ~matplotlib~ to extract the color pallete of an image. ~sklearn~ is used to cluster the colors and ~matplotlib~ is used to display the colors.

* Into GUI w PyGame
** [[file:/PyGam/Menger-Square/][Menger Sponge]
This is a simple program that creates a menger sponge using the pygame module. Uses rayMarching to render the sponge.
